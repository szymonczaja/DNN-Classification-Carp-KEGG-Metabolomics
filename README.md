🧬 Carp Classification Based on KEGG Metabolic Pathways (DNN)📝 Project SummaryThis academic project, developed during my Bioinformatics studies, focuses on the classification (prediction) of common carp originating from five different ponds that received varying nutritional supplementation. The classification is performed solely using data related to the activity of KEGG metabolic pathways.The main objective is to use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to identify subtle patterns within the complex metabolic data that allow for the successful distinction between carp groups. This work also showcases the sophisticated data preparation necessary for handling high-dimensional biological datasets.Unique Project Aspects:Integration of biological data (KEGG pathways) with advanced Deep Learning techniques.Handling multi-class classification ($N=5$) in a Bioinformatics context.Dimensionality Reduction addressing the $N \ll p$ problem (fewer samples than features).Application of Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) for model explainability.🛠️ Technologies UsedThe analysis was executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python and key data science libraries.<p align="center"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-R-276DC3?style=flat&logo=r&logoColor=white"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Keras-D00000?style=flat&logo=keras&logoColor=white"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-TensorFlow-FF6F00?style=flat&logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-scikit--learn-F7931E?style=flat&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-150458?style=flat&logo=pandas&logoColor=white"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-013243?style=flat&logo=numpy&logoColor=white"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Jupyter-F37626?style=flat&logo=jupyter&logoColor=white"></p>⚙️ Analytical Methodology1. KEGG Data Preprocessing and Dimensionality ReductionThe initial dataset had a significantly higher number of features than samples ($p \gg N$), which required aggressive dimensionality reduction.Correlation Feature Selection: Features that were highly correlated (Pearson correlation $> 0.9$) were handled by removing the one with the lower variance, as it was deemed less informative.Principal Component Analysis (PCA): The final reduction was performed using PCA to condense the data into an optimal number of components while preserving maximum variance.The data was then scaled and normalized for optimal neural network training.2. Deep Neural Network (DNN) ArchitectureA multi-layer DNN model was built using Keras/TensorFlow.ReLU activation was used in the hidden layers, and Softmax activation was applied in the output layer to handle the five classification classes.Hyperparameters (number of layers, neurons, optimizer) were carefully tuned to maximize predictive accuracy.3. Model Evaluation and InterpretationEvaluation Metrics: Model performance was assessed using Accuracy, Loss, and a detailed Confusion Matrix for the multi-class prediction.Model Explainability (PFI): Instead of SHAP, Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) was utilized to interpret the model. PFI helped determine which KEGG metabolic pathways were the most influential predictors, providing critical biological insight into the observed differences caused by supplementation and environment.
